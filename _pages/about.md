I'm a software engineer at [Rayark Inc.](https://www.rayark.com/), and also an independent researcher.
My research interests include audio signal processing, music information retrieval, binaural audio, and machine learning.

I love making contributions on Github. Some of my most starred projects are [torchnmf](https://github.com/yoyololicon/pytorch-NMF), an non-negative matrix factorization tool written in PyTorch, and [Constant Memory WaveGlow](https://github.com/yoyololicon/constant-memory-waveglow) which let you train WaveGlow vocoder in constant memory cost. I'm also the main contributor to making [torchaudio.functional.lfilter](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/functional.html#lfilter) differentiable.

My hobbies are music, manga, anime, and vtubers. My music taste is very broad and can be ranged from Heavy Metal, Djent, Post-Hardcore, to Happy Hardcore, Trance, Future Funk, Ani-Song, Lo-Fi, etc. I also produced some music (see my [portfolio](/music/) page) under the name **Y.C.Y**.
